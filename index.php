<h1>Welcome to my notebook shop!</h1>

<h2>Currently a work in progress...</h2>

<p>Currently i've mapped out the links of where I wish the user to be able
to go to, as well as make sure that the navigation bar stays consistent with every page
so that the user may select any part of my website when they wish to do so!</p>

<p>Once I have the pages created for all the content on the links redirected spots i'll 
attempt to automatically generate some information about computers and other types of data to make the pages nice!</p>

<p>I'll make sure to input my imaged design as a logo to be in the page when I make
improvements to it as i'm not particularly design savvy, hope everything looks to be acceptable so far!</p>
