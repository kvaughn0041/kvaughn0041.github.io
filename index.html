                <h1>Welcome to my notebook shop!</h1>

                <h2>Currently a work in progress...</h2>

                <p>Currently I've mapped out the links of where I wish the user to be able
                to go to, as well as make sure that the navigation bar stays consistent with every page
                so that the user may select any part of my website when they wish to do so!</p>

                <p>Once I have the pages created for all the content on the links redirected spots I'll 
                attempt to automatically generate some information about computers and other types of data to make the pages useful!
                however I believe this would have to be a side project if I were required to have my final product on GitHub because its not
                liking my PHP files, I had to convert my page over to some non auto generated HTML</p>

                <p>I'll make sure to input my imaged design as a logo to be in the page when I make
                improvements to it as i'm not particularly design savvy, hope 
                everything looks to be acceptable so far and the simple navigation layout is pleasing!</p>
